Predicting the Likelihood of Divorce Using Machine Learning Project Overview This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of divorce based on a comprehensive dataset of relational and psychological features. With rising global divorce rates, the project's goal is to use data-driven insights to identify at-risk relationships and help with early intervention strategies like counseling or therapy. The project employs various supervised learning models, evaluates their performance using key metrics, and identifies the best-performing models to provide valuable insights into relationship dynamics. Dataset The "Predicting Divorce" dataset is a structured collection of relational and psychological features obtained from survey responses. It contains 170 records and 54 attributes. Each record represents a couple's survey responses, with the target variable being a binary outcome(0 for stable, 1 for divorce). The dataset is ideal for binary classification tasks and its compact size allows for quick analysis and efficient training of lightweight models. The top features most correlated with divorce are: idk_what's_going_on (Correlation: 0.94) happy (Correlation: 0.93) roles (Correlation: 0.93) marriage (Correlation: 0.92) harmony (Correlation: 0.92) Tools and Techniques The project was developed using Python. The following libraries and tools were used: Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing. NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations. Matplotlib: For creating visualizations like graphs and curves. Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning models and evaluation metrics. Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for coding and analysis. Models and Evaluation We trained and evaluated the following supervised learning algorithms for binary classification : K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines (SVM) Na√Øve Bayes Decision Tree The models were evaluated using the following metrics to assess their predictive performance: Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances. Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified. F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. Confusion Matrix: A table showing the model's true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. Classification Report: A comprehensive summary including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. ROC-AUC Curve: A plot of the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate, where the Area Under the Curve (AUC) indicates the model's ability to distinguish between classes. Results and Findings The project successfully used Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression to achieve an impressive 100% accuracy in predicting the likelihood of divorce. The results are summarized in the table below:

Both SVM and Logistic Regression were highly effective and demonstrated the potential of machine learning in analyzing relationship dynamics. Future Work Potential future enhancements for this project include: Adding more data to the dataset to improve model generalizability. Exploring additional features that may influence marital stability to provide deeper insights into relationship dynamics.
